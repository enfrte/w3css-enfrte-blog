# w3css-enfrte-blog

### Description

This is my first WordPress theme. It's a simple blog using [W3CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/), based on [this template design](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_blog.htm), and the [Underscore_S](http://underscores.me/) starter theme. I've added some custom settings and a couple of custom widgets. You can experience a live demo of the theme [here](http://codinginthecold.byethost5.com/demos/bllt/).
